# Bin Reminder

Basically posts your postcode to a local council site and then sends it to Sack with the next person tagged to remind them to put out the bin and which one needs putting out.

This was thrown together around winter where I expected some issues to occur regarding the bins being picked up.

It stores the current person in a file so it's self contained.
